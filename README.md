# Ruleforge

_Disclaimer: This is written by Gemini 2.5 Pro on 23 June 2025 with the entire codebase in mind (to save time). **However, I have fact-checked the explanation to ensure accuracy.**_

Ruleforge is a sophisticated, highly configurable compiler designed to generate item filters for the game Path of Exile.
It transforms a modular, easy-to-read syntax (.rf files) into a complete, optimized item filter.
By integrating directly with Path of Building data and real-time economic information from poe.ninja,
Ruleforge allows for the creation of powerful,
data-driven, and context-aware filters that go far beyond what is possible with simple text-based filter editors.

## Core Concepts
Ruleforge is built around a few key ideas:

- **Modular Syntax**: Instead of a single, monolithic file, you define your filter logic in modular .rf script files using a clear and expressive syntax. 
- **Centralized Styling**: All visual aspects of the filter (colors, sizes, sounds, effects) are defined in a separate styles.json file. This separates logic from presentation, making styles reusable and easy to manage. 
- **Data-Driven Macros**: Ruleforge includes powerful macros that can automatically generate complex sets of rules based on game data. For example, it can create a full equipment progression for leveling, or automatically tier unique items and skill gems based on their market value. 
- **Economic Awareness**: By pulling data from poe.ninja, Ruleforge can make decisions based on an item's real economic value, ensuring your filter highlights what's truly valuable in the current league. 
- **Configuration over Hardcoding**: Key paths, league settings, and economic calculations are all controlled through a central config.json file, making the tool adaptable to your setup and preferences.

## Installation and Setup

### 1. Configuration (config.json)
Before running, you must configure Ruleforge by editing the config.json file.

```json
{
  "FilterOutputDirs": [
    "X:\\Ruleforge\\output",
    "C:\\Users\\YourUser\\Documents\\My Games\\Path of Exile"
  ],
  "RuleforgeInputDir": "X:\\Ruleforge\\test_input",
  "StyleJSONFile": "X:\\Ruleforge\\styles.json",
  "PathOfBuildingDataPath": "D:\\[...]\\Path of Building Community\\Data",
  "LeagueWeights": {
    "Hardcore Mercenaries" : 0.5,
    "Mercenaries":  0.3,
    "Hardcore":  0.15,
    "Standard": 0.05
  },
  "EconomyNormalizationStrategy": "Global",
  "EconomyWeights": {
    "Value": 0.65,
    "Rarity": 0.35
  },
  "ChaseVSGeneralPotentialFactor": 0.85
}
```

- **FilterOutputDirs**: An array of directories where the final .filter files will be saved. It's recommended to point one entry directly to your Path of Exile filter directory. 
- **RuleforgeInputDir**: The directory containing your .rf script files that you want to compile. 
- StyleJSONFile: The absolute path to your styles.json file. 
- **PathOfBuildingDataPath**: (Crucial) The absolute path to the Data directory within your Path of Building (Community Fork) installation. Ruleforge uses this to access up-to-date item base information. 
- **LeagueWeights**: Defines which poe.ninja leagues to pull economy data from and their relative importance in scoring calculations. The weights must sum to 1.0. 
- **EconomyNormalizationStrategy**: How to normalize economic data across leagues. Can be Global (all leagues normalized together) or Per-League. 
- **EconomyWeights**: The weighting between an item's chaos value (Value) and its availability (Rarity) when scoring. Must sum to 1.0. 
- **ChaseVSGeneralPotentialFactor**: A value between 0 and 1 that determines how to score unique items. A higher value gives more weight to the most valuable unique on a given base type (the "chase" item), while a lower value considers the average value of all uniques on that base.

### 2. Styling (styles.json)
The styles.json file is a hierarchical JSON object where you define all visual styles.
Styles can be nested and can inherit from each other using a Combination property.
This allows you to create base styles and layer more specific properties on top.

**Example styles.json entry:**

```json
{
  "Tiers": {
    "Celestial": {
      "Comment": "The absolute best drops.",
      "TextColor": {"red": 255, "green": 215, "blue": 0, "alpha": 255},
      "BorderColor": {"red": 255, "green": 215, "blue": 0, "alpha": 255},
      "FontSize": 45,
      "Beam": { "Color": "Pink", "Temp": false }
    }
  },
  "Special": {
    "Currencies": {
      "Orbs": {
        "Main": {
          "BackgroundColor": { "red": 50, "green": 40, "blue": 70, "alpha": 255 }
        },
        "T1": {
          "Combination": [ "Special/Currencies/Orbs/Main", "Tiers/Celestial" ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In this example,
the style `Special/Currencies/Orbs/T1` will inherit all properties from
`Special/Currencies/Orbs/Main` and `Tiers/Celestial`,
combining them into a single definitive style.

### 3. Running Ruleforge
You can either run the prebuilt `.exe` (Windows) that is contained on this GitHub, once the project is released. 
Or, you can build it from source if your target machine is not Windows.

## Ruleforge Syntax (.rf files)

### File Structure
A .rf file is composed of three types of top-level blocks: METADATA, var, and SECTION.

### Comments
Single-line comments start with `!!`.
Block comments are enclosed in `!![` and `]!!`.

```rf
!! This is a single-line comment.

!![
  This is a
  multi-line block comment.
]!!
```

### `METADATA` Block
Every script must start with a `METADATA` block, which defines the filter's overall properties.
```rf
METADATA {
  NAME           => "MyAwesomeFilter"
  VERSION        => "1.0"
  STRICTNESS     => "STRICT"
  BUILD          => "SHADOW"
}
```
- `NAME`: The output filename of the filter (e.g., MyAwesomeFilter â†’ which would compile into MyAwesomeFilter.filter). 
- `VERSION`: A version string for your reference. 
- `STRICTNESS`: A user-defined value. Can be `ALL`, `SOFT`, `SEMI-STRICT`, `STRICT`, `SUPER-STRICT`. 
  - Note: These are currently (23 June 2025) not used yet... These are on the to-do list to be implemented.
- `BUILD`: The character class archetype the filter is designed for. Macros use this to determine the appropriate gear. Valid options: `MARAUDER`, `RANGER`, `WITCH`, `TEMPLAR`, `DUELIST`, `SHADOW`.

### `var` Declarations
You can declare variables to store and combine styles.
This is extremely useful for creating reusable, complex styles.
Variables are prefixed with `$` when referenced (not when declared).

```rf
!! Var declaration
var rare_style = "ItemGroups/Equipment" + "Tiers/Primal"

!! If I were to reference this variable sometime later, I would say: $rare_style
```

### Style Overrides
When combining styles, you may have conflicts (e.g., both styles define a `FontSize`).
You can explicitly resolve these conflicts using an `!override` block.

```rf
var custom_weapon_style = "StyleA" + "StyleB" !override [
  "StyleB" => "FontSize"
]
```

This declaration combines `StyleA` and `StyleB`, but if both have a `FontSize`, the one from `StyleB` will be used.

**The default behavior is to use everything from `StyleA` if there is a conflict present,
UNLESS an `!override` block is defined.
In this case, it will override only the specific elements specified.
Obviously if there are no conflicts, it's a simple combination (this would be preferred).**

### `SECTION` Block
Sections are the core organizational unit of the filter.
They group a set of rules under a common theme and can apply conditions to all rules within them.

```rf
SECTION {
  SECTION_METADATA {
    NAME        => "Flasks"
    DESCRIPTION => "Rules for all utility and life/mana flasks"
  }

  SECTION_CONDITIONS {
    WHERE @item_class == "Flask"
  }

  RULES {
    !! Rules go here...
  }
}
```

- `SECTION_METADATA`: Contains the `NAME` and `DESCRIPTION` of the section, which are used to generate a Table of Contents in the final filter file. 
- `SECTION_CONDITIONS`: A block where you can define conditions that apply to every rule inside this section. This is great for reducing repetition. 
- `RULES`: The block that contains the actual filter rules and macros for this section.

### Rule Syntax
The standard rule format is a chain of a condition, a style, and an action.

`WHERE <condition> => <style> => <action>`
- `WHERE`: The start of every rule. 
- Condition: Defines what item property to check. 
  - Identifiers: `@area_level`, `@stack_size`, `@item_type`, `@item_class`, `@rarity`, `@sockets`, `@socket_group`, `@height`, `@width`. 
  - Operators: `==`, `!=`, `>=`, `<=`, `>`, `<`. 
  - Value: A quoted string `"value"`, a number, or a variable reference `$var`. 
- Style: A reference to a style defined in `styles.json`, either by its full path (`Essences/Tiers/High`) or via a variable (`$my_style`). 
- Action: What to do with the item. Can be `$Show` or `$Hide`.

**Example:**
```rf
RULES {
  !! Show rare helmets with an item level of 86 or higher using the celestial style
  WHERE @rarity == "Rare" -> @item_class == "Helmets" -> @item_level >= 86 => "Tiers/Celestial" => $Show
  
  !! Whitespace is optional. For brevity, the following is allowed too:
  WHERE @rarity=="Rare"->@item_class=="Helmets"->@item_level>=86=>"Tiers/Celestial"=>$Show
}
```

### Macros
Macros are powerful commands that generate large numbers of rules automatically.

`MACRO["<macro_name>"-><parameters>]`

`item_progression-equipment` & `item_progression-flasks`
These macros generate a complete set of Show/Hide rules for equipment or flasks to guide the leveling process.
They automatically use drop-level data from Path of Building.

```rf
MACRO["item_progression-equipment"
  -> $show_normal => $leveling_style
  -> $show_magic  => $leveling_style
  -> $show_rare   => $leveling_style_rare
  -> $hidden_normal => $hidden_style
  -> $hidden_magic  => $hidden_style
  -> $hidden_rare   => $hidden_style
]
```

`unique_tiering` & `skill_gem_tiering`
These macros fetch economy data from poe.ninja
and use K-Means clustering to automatically group unique items or skill gems into tiers.
You provide a style for each tier.

```rf
!! The name of each parameter is irrelevant in this example (since it's not used by the macro)
MACRO["unique_tiering"
  -> $tier1 => "Special/Uniques_T1_Chase"
  -> $tier2 => "Special/Uniques_T2_Exceptional"
  -> $tier3 => "Special/Uniques_T3_Valuable"
  -> $tier4 => "Special/Uniques_T4_Useful"
  -> $tier5 => "Special/Uniques_T5_Common"
]
```

`handle_csv`
This macro generates rules based on a CSV file,
allowing for easy management of large, repetitive rule sets like currencies or essences.
It uses the `basetype_automation_config.csv` file by default.

```rf
MACRO["handle_csv"->$category=>"Orbs"]
```
This command would process all rows in the CSV file where the `Category` column is "Orbs,"
generating a rule for each one based on its configured `Basetype`, `MinStackSize`, `Style`, and `Tier`.
